-- During a year, in which months do we have the highest number of crimes? As you expected?

It is highest in August, likely because the weather is really nice. This means that
people are going out and having a good time. This could also be due to people being on vacation and
leaving the house for longer periods of time, leaving the possiblity for theft open.
