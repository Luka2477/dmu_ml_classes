-- Given a rough map of Chicago based on Districts/GPS coordinates.
-- We can then ask about the concentration of a certain crime.
-- Compare battery, theft and narcotics – what is happening here?
-- Compare also with “Deceptive practice”. Is homicide and narcotics related? And what about narcotics and
-- "crime sexual assault"?

Battery is all over the place, meaning that there is no point of interest.
Theft is very localized to downtown central. Likely due to a concentration of people, cars and tourists.
Narcotics is vert localized to one point in the outskirts of Chicago. This is likely due to poverty, gangs and police
presence.
